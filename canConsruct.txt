Write a f(x) `canConstruct(target, wordBank)` that accepts a target string and an array of strings.

the f(x) should return a boolean indicating whether or not `target` can be constructed by the concatenating elements of the `wordBank` array.

you may reuse elements of `wordBank` as many times as needed.

this is the same type of problem as the canSum algorithm. Instead of numbers though,
this is using strings and letters.
