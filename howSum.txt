much like canSum, with howSum we want to return the first possible combination of numbers, that equal the targetSum
or return null.

all numbers must be positive, and if it is 0 then return and empty array [].

this code funcitons a lot like the canSum function in that they both take the same args
but output different answers.

an example tree of this:

7 [5, 4, 3, 7];

7 -5(2) -4(3) -3(4) -7(0)

2 = null | 3(-3[0]) 3(-4[null]) | 4(-2[2 { -2 > 0[] }]) 4(-3[1 null]) | 0 = []

in this instance it would return the first set which is [3, 4].
