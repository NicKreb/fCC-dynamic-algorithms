Write a function called allConstruct() that accepts a target string and array of strings

The function should return a 2d array containing all the ways
that the target can be constructed by concatenating elements of the wordBank array.
Each element of the 2D array should represent one combo that constructs the target.

You can reuse elements of wordBank as many times as needed.
