-----Tabulation recipe:------
*visualize the problem as a table:
    what are the size and dimensions of the table?

*size the table based on the imputs
    ex: fib(n) was a dimension of n and size of n.
    where as grid had two inputs and required more of a grid display

*initialize the table with default values:
    such as the (0,0) and (1,1) in grid.

*seed the trivial answer into the table.
    this should be a trivially small input and incredibly easy/fast for the
    computer to process. such as fib(1) and fib(2).
    and (1,1) in grid

*iterate through the table

*fill further positions based on the current position in the table.
    Add 1 space and 2 spaces ahead in fib, or one below and one to the right in grid.
    pay attention to the language of the problem and options within the problem
    like moving down and right, or adding the prev two spaces.
