Write a f(x) of howSum(targetSum, numbers) that takes in targetSum and an arr of nums as args.

the f(x)  should return an array containing any combo of elements that add up to exactly the target sum.

if there is no combo that adds up to the targetSum return null.

table length is = targetSum + 1

the return should likely require a 2D array similar to the gridtravelerTab.js file.

if there are multiple combos possible, you may return any single one.
