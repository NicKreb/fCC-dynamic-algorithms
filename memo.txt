memoization recipe:

1. Make a recursive solution that works first.
    a. visualize the problems as a tree
    b. implement the tree using recursion
        *. think of the leaves like base cases!
    c. test out the solution, this will be considered the brute force recurssion.

2. Then memoize it and seek out efficiency for the solution.
    a. add a memo object
    b. add a base case to return memo values
    c. store return values into the memo
