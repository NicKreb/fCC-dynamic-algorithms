write a function fib(n) that takes in a number as an arg.
The function should return the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence

the 0th num of the sequence is 0.
the 1st num of the sequence is 1.

to Generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

the approach we are going to take is called Tabulation

-building a table.

fib(6) -> 8

were choosing to think about it in terms of subproblems, however. Rather than 
approach it recursively, we approach it iteratively and use an array.

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

The first thing we do, is initialize every cell of the table in zero.
This is especially useful, in the fact that Fibonacci requires us to take the sum.
and Zero is a really good starting point.

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

here we want the first index to represent the value of 1.

now we just need to do is iterate through
